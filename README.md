# Í°å‚ÄçÍ°ô‚ÄçÍ°ö Escaping the maze

This is a Python script that provides a universal solution for all challenges in Reeborg's World.

## Introduction

Reeborg's World is an educational platform that allows users to learn programming through interactive challenges. The challenges involve controlling a virtual robot named Reeborg to perform specific tasks in a grid-based environment.

## Universal Solution

The provided code snippet offers a universal solution for all challenges in Reeborg's World, ranging from the "Alone" challenge to the "Maze" challenge. However, the actual solution logic is missing from the code. It seems to define a function turn_right() that turns the robot to the right, and a while loop that executes until the robot reaches the goal.

To complete the code and solve a specific challenge, you need to add the appropriate logic inside the while loop based on the requirements of that particular challenge. This might involve using conditions such as wall_on_right(), front_is_clear(), wall_in_front(), and right_is_clear() to make decisions about the robot's movements and actions.

Feel free to modify the code and add the necessary instructions to solve a specific challenge in Reeborg's World.

## Example

To demonstrate the usage of the code, let's consider a hypothetical challenge where the robot needs to move forward until it reaches the goal:

```bash
def turn_right():
    for i in range(3):
        turn_left()

while not at_goal():
    if (wall_on_right() and front_is_clear()):
        move()
    elif (wall_on_right() and wall_in_front()):
        turn_left()
    elif (wall_in_front() and right_is_clear()):
        turn_right()
        move()
    elif (front_is_clear() and right_is_clear()):
        turn_right()
        move()
```

![Escaping the maze](Images/escaping_the_maze.gif)

In this example, the robot checks if the front is clear. If it is, the robot moves forward. If there is a wall in front, the robot turns left. This logic will continue until the robot reaches the goal.

Please note that this is just an example, and the actual solution depends on the specific challenge you are working on.

# üßóüèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hangman Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Hangman. The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player has to guess the letters in the word to complete it before running out of lives.

```bash
  +---+
  |   |
  O   |
 /|\  |
 / \  |
      |
=========
```

## How to Play

1. Run the main.py file.
2. The program will display the Hangman ASCII art logo.
3. It will then select a random word from the list of words.
4. The word will be displayed as a series of underscores representing the letters.
5. Guess a letter by entering it in the console.
6. If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word.
7. If the letter is incorrect, you will lose a life, and a part of the Hangman figure will be displayed.
8. Continue guessing letters until you complete the word or run out of lives.
9. If you complete the word, you win the game.
10. If you run out of lives, you lose the game.

## File Descriptions

- main.py: The main program file that runs the Hangman game.
- hangman.py: Contains the ASCII art representations of the Hangman figure at different stages.
- words.py: Stores the list of words used for the game.

              88  
```

## Usage

The main.py file contains the main program logic for the Caesar Cipher. It includes the following functions:

    casesarCipher(command, message, shift): This function takes three arguments: command (either "e" for encoding or "d" for decoding), message (the text to be encoded or decoded), and shift (the number of positions to shift the characters). It performs the Caesar Cipher encryption or decryption based on the command and prints the encoded or decoded result.

The program prompts the user to enter the command, message, and shift value. It then calls the casesarCipher function to process the input and display the result. After each encryption or decryption, the program asks if the user wants to go again. Entering "n" exits the program.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

## Running the Program

To run the program, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```
Follow the prompts in the console to choose the command (encode or decode), enter the message, and specify the shift value. The program will display the encoded or decoded result and ask if you want to go again.

## Example

Here is an example interaction with the program:

```bash
Type 'e' for 'encode' or 'd' for 'decode': e
Type your message (make sure to add only these symbols: space, !, @, #, $, &, ?): hello world
Type the shift number (0-42): 5
Here's the encoded result: mjqqt%ryj%wtaqi
Type 'y' for 'yes' if you want to go again, else type 'n' for 'no': n
Caesar Cipher says: 0mmb6w2bioiqvcbowwlbvqop?
```

Hint: Add all the numbers in the above message and use the result as the shift number to get the decrypted message of Caesar Cipher üòâ

# üë®üèª‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è The Secret Auction Program

This project implements a simple secret auction program using Python. The program allows participants to enter their name and bid amount, and it determines the winner with the highest bid.

```bash
                         ___________
                         \         /

                       .-------------.
                      |_______________|
```

## Usage

auction.py

The auction.py file contains the main program logic for the secret auction. It includes the following functions:

    auction(): This function prompts the user for their name and bid amount, and stores them as key-value pairs in the auctionMembers dictionary.
    The program starts by printing the program logo. It then calls the auction() function to collect the bids from the participants. After all bids are entered, the program determines the winner with the highest bid and displays the result.

The program prompts the user to indicate whether there are any other bidders. Entering "n" ends the auction and proceeds to calculate the winner.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

## Running the Program

To run the program, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the prompts in the console to enter the bidder's name and bid amount. If there are more bidders, enter "y" when prompted. Once all bids are entered, the program will display the winner with the highest bid. If no bid is entered or all bids are zero or negative, no winner will be declared.

## Example

Here is an example interaction with the program:

```bash
What is your name?: John
What is your bid?: ‚Çπ5000
Are there any other bidders? Type 'y' for 'yes' or 'n' for 'no': y
What is your name?: Jane
What is your bid?: ‚Çπ7000
Are there any other bidders? Type 'y' for 'yes' or 'n' for 'no': n
The winner is Jane with a bid of ‚Çπ7000
```
