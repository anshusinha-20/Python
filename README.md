# Í°å‚ÄçÍ°ô‚ÄçÍ°ö Escaping the maze

This is a Python script that provides a universal solution for all challenges in Reeborg's World.

## Introduction

Reeborg's World is an educational platform that allows users to learn programming through interactive challenges. The challenges involve controlling a virtual robot named Reeborg to perform specific tasks in a grid-based environment.

## Universal Solution

The provided code snippet offers a universal solution for all challenges in Reeborg's World, ranging from the "Alone" challenge to the "Maze" challenge. However, the actual solution logic is missing from the code. It seems to define a function turn_right() that turns the robot to the right, and a while loop that executes until the robot reaches the goal.

To complete the code and solve a specific challenge, you need to add the appropriate logic inside the while loop based on the requirements of that particular challenge. This might involve using conditions such as wall_on_right(), front_is_clear(), wall_in_front(), and right_is_clear() to make decisions about the robot's movements and actions.

Feel free to modify the code and add the necessary instructions to solve a specific challenge in Reeborg's World.

## Example

To demonstrate the usage of the code, let's consider a hypothetical challenge where the robot needs to move forward until it reaches the goal:

```bash
def turn_right():
    for i in range(3):
        turn_left()

while not at_goal():
    if (wall_on_right() and front_is_clear()):
        move()
    elif (wall_on_right() and wall_in_front()):
        turn_left()
    elif (wall_in_front() and right_is_clear()):
        turn_right()
        move()
    elif (front_is_clear() and right_is_clear()):
        turn_right()
        move()
```

![Escaping the maze](Images/escaping_the_maze.gif)

In this example, the robot checks if the front is clear. If it is, the robot moves forward. If there is a wall in front, the robot turns left. This logic will continue until the robot reaches the goal.

Please note that this is just an example, and the actual solution depends on the specific challenge you are working on.

              88
              88
```

## Usage

The main.py file contains the main program logic for the Caesar Cipher. It includes the following functions:

    casesarCipher(command, message, shift): This function takes three arguments: command (either "e" for encoding or "d" for decoding), message (the text to be encoded or decoded), and shift (the number of positions to shift the characters). It performs the Caesar Cipher encryption or decryption based on the command and prints the encoded or decoded result.

The program prompts the user to enter the command, message, and shift value. It then calls the casesarCipher function to process the input and display the result. After each encryption or decryption, the program asks if the user wants to go again. Entering "n" exits the program.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

## Running the Program

To run the program, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the prompts in the console to choose the command (encode or decode), enter the message, and specify the shift value. The program will display the encoded or decoded result and ask if you want to go again.

## Example

Here is an example interaction with the program:

```bash
Type 'e' for 'encode' or 'd' for 'decode': e
Type your message (make sure to add only these symbols: space, !, @, #, $, &, ?): hello world
Type the shift number (0-42): 5
Here's the encoded result: mjqqt%ryj%wtaqi
Type 'y' for 'yes' if you want to go again, else type 'n' for 'no': n
Caesar Cipher says: 0mmb6w2bioiqvcbowwlbvqop?
```

Hint: Add all the numbers in the above message and use the result as the shift number to get the decrypted message of Caesar Cipher üòâ

# ü§î‚ùî Quiz

This readme provides an overview of the quiz project, including the main files and their functionality.

## main.py

The main.py file is the entry point of the quiz project. It imports the necessary modules and initializes the question bank.

```bash
from question_model import Question
from data import question_data

# Empty list
questionBank = []

# Loop through question_data and append questions and answers to the questionBank list
for i in question_data:
    questionBank.append(Question(i["text"], i["answer"]))
```

The code imports the Question class from the question_model module and the question_data list from the data module. It then initializes an empty questionBank list and populates it by creating Question objects based on the data from question_data.

## data.py

The data.py file contains the question data and answers in the question_data list.

```bash
question_data = [
    {"text": "A slug's blood is green.", "answer": "True"},
    {"text": "The loudest animal is the African Elephant.", "answer": "False"},
    # ...
]
```

The question_data list consists of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a question with its text and answer.

## question_model.py

The question_model.py file defines the Question class.

```bash
class Question:
    def __init__(self, question, answer):
        self.quizQuestion = question
        self.quizAnswer = answer
```

The Question class has an **init** method that initializes each question object with a quizQuestion and a quizAnswer.

## quiz_brain.py

The quiz_brain.py file contains the QuizBrain class, which manages the quiz questions and user interactions.

```bash
class QuizBrain:
    def __init__(self, qList):
        self.questionNumber = 0
        self.questionList = qList

    def nextQuestion(self):
        currentQuestion = self.questionList[self.questionNumber]
        self.questionNumber += 1
        input(f"Q.{self.questionNumber}: {currentQuestion.text} (True/False): ")
```

The QuizBrain class has an **init** method that takes a question list (qList) as a parameter. It also has a nextQuestion method that retrieves the current question from the question list and prompts the user for an answer.

## Getting Started

To run the quiz project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

5. The program will display each question from the question bank and prompt the user for an answer. You can modify the project code to add additional features or customize the quiz experience.

# üñºÔ∏è The Hirst Painting Project

This readme provides an overview of the Hirst painting project, including the main function and its functionality.

![The hirst painting](Images/the_hirst_painting.gif)

## Project Description

The Hirst painting project aims to create a painting using a turtle graphic with randomly colored dots. The project utilizes the colorgram module, a third-party library in Python, to extract colors from an image and apply them to the dots.

## Project Details

main.py

The main.py file contains the main function timCreateHirstPainting that generates the Hirst painting.

```bash
def timCreateHirstPainting(x, y):
    import colorgram

    colors = colorgram.extract("image1.jpg", 50)

    colorList = []

    for color in colors:
        red = color.rgb.r
        green = color.rgb.g
        blue = color.rgb.b
        rgbColor = (red, green, blue)
        colorList.append(rgbColor)

    # Tim's configurations
    turtle.colormode(255)
    tim.penup()
    tim.goto(-200, -200)

    dotsNumber = 100

    for dot in range(1, dotsNumber + 1):
        tim.dot(20, random.choice(colorList))
        tim.forward(40)

        if dot % 10 == 0:
            tim.setheading(90)
            tim.forward(40)
            tim.setheading(180)
            tim.forward(400)
            tim.setheading(0)

    tim.hideturtle()
    screen.exitonclick()

screen.onscreenclick(timCreateHirstPainting, 1)
turtle.mainloop()
```

The timCreateHirstPainting function performs the following steps:

1. Imports the colorgram module to extract colors from the image.
2. Extracts and stores 50 colors from the provided image.
3. Configures Tim's turtle graphic.
4. Iterates through a loop to create and color the dots.
5. Moves the turtle according to a pattern.
6. Hides the turtle and waits for a click event to exit the screen.
7. The onscreenclick function binds the timCreateHirstPainting function to a mouse click event on the screen.

## Getting Started

To run the Hirst painting project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Install the required dependencies, such as the colorgram module.
